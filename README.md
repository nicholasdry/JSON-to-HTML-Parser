# JSON to HTML Parser
A python script which parses JSON files and generates boilerplate HTML code.

# Usage
This script is specifically an alteration/recreation of the Quiver export to HTML code.

Place the driver.py file into a directory with several .json files, named whatever they may be, and the script will grab the name of the file and export an HTML file accordingly then run the following command:

```
> python3 driver.py
```

Then the script will generate an index.html file which can be uploaded along with the other .html files to a web server.

# Future Developments
- Allow the script to access multiple directories and link them up to a larger index page for easier browsing.
